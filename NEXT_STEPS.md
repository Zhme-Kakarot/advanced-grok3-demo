# Next Steps for Advanced C++ Study

This file outlines the immediate next steps for progressing in my Advanced C++ Study with Grok, as of February 20, 2025. Itâ€™s a companion to `README.md` and `demo.cpp`, keeping my focus clear as I work toward mastering the "extremely advanced" demo.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - If not already done, create the repository: `https://github.com/Zhme-Kakarot/cpp-advanced-study`.
   - Clone it, add the updated files (`README.md`, `demo.cpp`, and this `NEXT_STEPS.md`), and push:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Zhme-Kakarot/cpp-advanced-study.git
     cd cpp-advanced-study
     # Add README.md, demo.cpp, and NEXT_STEPS.md
     git add README.md demo.cpp NEXT_STEPS.md
     git commit -m "Updated demo with requires clauses, generalized sum, and added next steps"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Start Assignment 1**:
   - Create a branch for the first assignment: `git checkout -b assignment1`.
   - Write `assignment1.cpp` to compute `3!` (6) using a `Factorial<N>` struct (see `README.md` for details).
   - Push the branch to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add assignment1.cpp
     git commit -m "Completed Assignment 1: Factorial"
     git push origin assignment1
     ```

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Share the repository link or code with Grok (via our ongoing conversation) when ready.
   - Expect detailed feedback, answers to questions, and suggestions for improvement.

## Notes
- The `demo.cpp` file is confirmed to compile and run with a C++23 compiler (e.g., GCC 14 with `-std=c++23 -ltbb`), making it a solid target.
- Next steps will evolve as I complete assignments and update this file accordingly.

Keep pushing forward, Zhme-Kakarot!
