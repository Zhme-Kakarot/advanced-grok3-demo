# Next Steps for Advanced C++ Study

This file outlines the immediate next steps for progressing in my Advanced C++ Study with Grok, as of February 20, 2025. Itâ€™s a companion to `README.md` and `demo.cpp`, keeping my focus clear as I work toward mastering the "extremely advanced" demo.

---

## Current State
- Repository: `https://github.com/Zhme-Kakarot/advanced-grok3-demo`
- Assignment 1: Completed and merged into `main` as `assignments/assignment1.cpp`.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify and Polish `main`**:
   - Confirm all files (`assignments/assignment1.cpp`, `.gitignore`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `README.md`, `demo.cpp`) are in `main`.
   - Update `README.md` to reflect the `assignments/` folder structure (e.g., change paths to `assignments/assignment1.cpp`).
   - Share `.gitignore` contents with Grok for verification.
   - Commit and push:
     ```bash
     git add README.md .gitignore NEXT_STEPS.md
     git commit -m "Updated README for assignments folder and refined NEXT_STEPS"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Start Assignment 2**:
   - Create a branch: `git checkout -b assignment2`.
   - Write `assignments/assignment2.cpp` to define a `Printable` concept and test with `int` and `double` (see `README.md`).
   - Push the branch:
     ```bash
     git add assignments/assignment2.cpp
     git commit -m "Completed Assignment 2: Printable Concept"
     git push origin assignment2
     ```

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Share the updated repo link or `assignment2` branch with Grok for review.
   - Expect feedback on concepts, syntax, and progression toward `demo.cpp`.

## Notes
- `demo.cpp` compiles with `g++-14 -std=c++23 -ltbb`, serving as the ultimate target.
- Next steps will shift to Assignment 3 (lambdas) after mastering concepts.

Keep pushing forward, Zhme-Kakarot!
