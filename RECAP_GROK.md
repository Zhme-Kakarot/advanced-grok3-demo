# I need to continue my Grok with a fresh conversation
The scroll bar has gotten absurd. I can hardly scroll without jumping past what I am looking for, and using the arrows to scroll is too slow. I asked Grok to help me transfer to a new conversation with this prompt: "Okay, can we try something?  The scroll bar is getting ridiculous. I want to be able to look over the earlier parts of the conversation, and I also want to share this conversation in my GitHub project, so can you output something that I can copy and past into a fresh Grok conversation that will let me continue my curriculum and my examples where we are now?"

Disclaimer: I have replaced queries intermittently to keep the curriculum as close to my scrollbar as possible. There have been many questions in between for clarity and direction. I also am not planning these queries ahead of time. This is my raw thoguht process. Please excuse anything that is gay and/or retarded.

Also, this conversation begins by pasting some code from the same concept that was working with Grok 2. To compare the quality of Grok 3's code output, and to continue with the same concepts that I had begun with.

Here is a link to the prior conversation: https://x.com/i/grok?conversation=1892593073781162039

The following content shows what Grok output, and I have pasted it into a new conversation that, so far, is working perfectly.

Hi Grok! I’m Zhme-Kakarot, working on an advanced C++ study project with you in my repo: https://github.com/Zhme-Kakarot/advanced-grok3-demo. We’ve been progressing through a curriculum to master concepts for an “extremely advanced” demo.cpp (with templates, concepts, lambdas, etc.). Here’s where we’re at as of February 20, 2025:

**Curriculum Progress:**
- **Assignment 1**: Done - `assignments/assignment1.cpp` computes `Factorial<3>` (6) with recursive templates. Merged into `main`.
- **Assignment 2**: Done - `assignments/assignment2.cpp` defines a `Printable` concept, prints 42 and 3.14. Pushed to `assignment2` branch, merged after fixing `.gitignore` issue with `git add -f`.
- **Assignment 3**: Done - `assignments/assignment3.cpp` uses `std::for_each` with a lambda to print a vector `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`. Pushed to `assignment3` branch, ready to merge.
- **Next**: Assignment 4 (smart pointers with `std::unique_ptr`).

**Lambda Practice (15 Examples):**
- **Basic (1-5)**: Done - Coded and understood:
  1. Greeting Printer: Standalone lambda prints “Hello, Zhme!”.
  2. Value Doubler: Stored lambda doubles 5 and 10.
  3. Counter Incrementer: ` [&counter]() { counter++; }` called thrice, prints 3.
  4. Odd Number Checker: Returns `true` for odd ints, tested 7 and 8.
  5. Simple Vector Printer: `std::for_each` prints `{1, 2, 3}`.
- **Intermediate (6-10)**: Done - Coded with explanations:
  6. Vector Multiplier: `std::for_each_n` fills vector with multiples of 3.
  7. Even Filter: Prints even numbers from `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
  8. Cumulative Product: Running product of `{2, 3, 4}`.
  9. Square Transformer: `std::transform` squares `{1.5, 2.5, 3.5}`.
  10. Reverse Sorter: Sorts `{5, 2, 8, 1}` ascending (intended descending typo).
- **Advanced (11-15)**: Listed, not yet expanded - Ready when I say “Next 5”.

**Current State:**
- Repo: `main` has Assignment 1, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `demo.cpp`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`. Assignments 2 and 3 are in branches.
- Focus: Just finished Intermediate lambda examples; discussed `std::for_each` in Example 5 and callable options (lambdas, functors, etc.).
- Questions: Asked about looking up function signatures—`cppreference.com` is key.

**Requests:**
1. Merge `assignment3` into `main`—need PR title/description (similar to Assignment 2: “Assignment 2: Printable Concept”, “Defined Printable concept…”).
2. Start Assignment 4 write-up (smart pointers with `std::unique_ptr`).
3. When ready, say “Next 5” for Advanced lambda examples (11-15).
4. Keep answers concise to avoid scroll overload—expand on request.

Let’s continue from here—where should we start?
